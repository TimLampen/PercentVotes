#This reward is called whenever the other ones aren't, so if the plugin passes all the other rewards because of the chance, then it will do this one

command:
#Messages sent went the player does the command /vote
- "&bVoteLink 1 - www.google.com"
- "&aVoteLink 2 - spigotmc.org"
  
#If useGUI is set to true, change to follow this:
#- [InvSpot]@[MaterialID]@[Name]@[OnClick(Optional)]

#Ex. - 0@1@&4Link1@www.minecraftservers.org/coolserver
#This would add an item at the first slot (Java starts counting at 0, the item would be stone with a name of "Link 1" and when it is clicked it will send the user to minecraftservers.org)

#Messages sent to player when he does /rewards
- "&41/100 chance to get Reward1"
- "&a1/1000 chance to get Reward2"
- "&b69/100 chance to get Reward69"

ranks:
  
  A:

#This is how much it costs to rankup to the next rank for example A is 1000 because it costs 1000 to rank up to B

  B:
    cost: 50000
    nextrank: C
  
  C:
    cost: 750000

#Once you have set the last rank, put 'end' so that the plugin knows that its the last rank
